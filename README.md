# AWS Cloudformation Template Builder

This repository contains `cfn-skeleton`, a command line tool and Go library that consumes the published [CloudFormation specification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html) and generates skeleton CloudFormation templates with mandatory and optional parameters of chosen resource types pre-filled with placeholder values.

## License

This project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. 

## Usage

To use `cfn-skeleton`, you can clone this repository and run `go build` or download the [latest release](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-template-builder/releases/latest) for your operating system.

```console
cfn-skeleton [OPTIONS] [RESOURCE TYPES...]

  cfn-skeleton is a tool that generates skeleton CloudFormation templates
  containing definitions for the resource types that you specify.

  You can use a short name for a resource type so long as it is unambiguous.
  For example 'Bucket', 'S3::Bucket', and 'AWS::S3::Bucket' refer to the same type.
  But 'Instance' would need disambiguation.

Options:

  -b, --bare  Produce a minimal template, omitting all optional resource properties.
  -i, --iam   If any resource includes an IAM policy definition, populate that too.
  -j, --json  Output the template in JSON format (default: YAML).
  --help      Show this message and exit.
```

Resource names must be delimited by spaces. If you specify more than one of the same resource type, you will get multiple resources in the output template; `cfn-skeleton` will ensure that the names are unique by adding numbers.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```console
cfn-skeleton -b Bucket EC2::Instance
```

Output:
```yaml
# Template generated by cfn-skeleton
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"

Resources:
  MyBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      {}

  MyInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      {} 
```

### Output JSON

To output JSON, use the `-j` or `--json` flag.

> Note that JSON output will include comments that help you identify optional properties of CloudFormation resources; however, comments are not supported in the [JSON specification](http://www.json.org/) and will be rejected by AWS CloudFormation. Once you have finished editing your template, ensure that you remove all comments.

```console

cfn-skeleton -b -j Bucket
```

Output
```json
{  // Template generated by cfn-skeleton
    "AWSTemplateFormatVersion": "2010-09-09",

    "Resources": {
        "MyBucket": {
            "Type": "AWS::S3::Bucket",
            "Properties": {}
        }
    }
}
```
